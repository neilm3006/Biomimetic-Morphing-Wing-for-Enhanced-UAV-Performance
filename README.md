# 🦅 Morphing Wing Prototype — Bioinspired Adaptive UAV Wing Design

This project explores the design, prototyping, and refinement of a morphing UAV wing inspired by biological systems and aerodynamic optimization principles. The wing is designed to perform two key types of morphing:

- **Flap Morphing (Up/Down)**
- **Variable Aerofoil Thickness Morphing**

Both mechanisms are implemented using a **servo-driven rack and pinion system**, allowing dynamic adaptation of the wing shape during simulated flight conditions.

### 🌟 Why Morphing Wings?

Morphing wings offer substantial advantages over conventional fixed-wing designs, such as:

- ✅ Improved lift-to-drag ratio under changing flight conditions  
- ✅ Enhanced fuel efficiency during cruise  
- ✅ Greater maneuverability and delayed stall characteristics

## 🧪 Initial Prototype

The first prototype was 3D printed using **TPU 95A** filament due to its flexibility and elastic properties that allow smooth deformation. Key insights from this version:

- ❌ **Structural Weakness**: The fully-TPU construction lacked the rigidity required to withstand aerodynamic loads.
- ❌ **Low ROI on Thickness Morphing**: The complexity of the variable thickness mechanism did not yield significant aerodynamic benefit.

## 🔬 Bioinspired Redesign: From Nature to Wing

To improve performance, the design took inspiration from natural aerodynamic features:

### 🐋 Leading Edge Tubercles  
Inspired by the **humpback whale**, these leading-edge bumps disrupt airflow to reduce stall and increase lift. According to research:

- **+8%** lift increase  
- **+40%** increase in stall angle  
- **−32%** drag in post-stall  

### 🏌️‍♂️ Golf Ball Dimples  
Inspired by golf ball aerodynamics, micro-dimples were added to the wing surface to create a turbulent boundary layer that adheres longer:

- **2–4%** pressure drag reduction  
- Improved L/D ratio in transitional flow conditions

## 🧱 Material Redesign: Dual-Material 3D Print Strategy

To overcome structural limitations, the redesigned wing features a **dual-material architecture**:

- **PLA (Rigid)**: For structural cores and non-morphing areas  
  - Provides strength and weight savings  
- **TPU 95A (Flexible)**: For flaps and morphing regions  
  - Enables smooth servo-driven actuation  

This hybrid setup ensures both **flexibility** for morphing and **stiffness** for structural integrity.
